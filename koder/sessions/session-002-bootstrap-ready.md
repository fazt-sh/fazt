# Session 002: Bootstrap Chain Ready for Admin SPA Planning

**Date**: December 9, 2025
**Model**: Sonnet 4.5
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Ready for Next Session
**Branch**: master (API work merged)

---

## 🎯 Mission Accomplished

### 1. Reviewed User's Vision
- ✅ Read `koder/rough.md` (user's scattered thoughts for Admin SPA)
- ✅ Understood requirements:
  - Vanilla SPA (no build tools)
  - PWA-capable
  - Mock data system with `?mock-data`
  - Tailwind CSS CDN + Inter font
  - Light/dark mode, theme color rgb(255, 149, 0)
  - Super elegant, minimal, functional UX
  - ES6 modules, component architecture
  - State management
  - API-driven UI design

### 2. Refined Bootstrap Chain
- ✅ Updated `koder/NEXT_SESSION.md` for Admin SPA planning phase
- ✅ Committed changes (clean working tree)
- ✅ Verified bootstrap protocol in `koder/start.md` works correctly

### 3. Clean Repository State
- ✅ All API standardization work committed (11 commits by Haiku + 1 by Sonnet)
- ✅ API work merged to master
- ✅ Working tree clean
- ✅ Ready for next phase

## 📋 Bootstrap Chain Verification

### Current State
```
koder/start.md (entry point)
    ↓
koder/NEXT_SESSION.md (points to Admin SPA planning)
    ↓
koder/rough.md (user's vision)
    ↓
koder/plans/11_api-standardization.md (what's built - API)
```

### Next Session Flow
When user says: **"read and execute koder/start.md"**

1. ✅ Sonnet reads `start.md`
2. ✅ Follows protocol → reads `NEXT_SESSION.md`
3. ✅ Sees: "Admin SPA Planning & Design"
4. ✅ Reads `rough.md` (user's scattered thoughts)
5. ✅ Asks clarifying questions (scope, technical decisions, design)
6. ✅ Creates comprehensive plan: `koder/plans/12_admin-spa-rebuild.md`
7. ✅ Updates `NEXT_SESSION.md` for build phase

**No ambiguity. Clear path forward.**

## 📊 What's Queued for Next Session

### Phase 1: Discussion (Sonnet + User)
**Questions to clarify:**
- Page structure (Dashboard, Sites, Analytics, Settings?)
- Priority features (MVP vs v2)
- Component architecture preference
- State management approach
- Development location (admin/ folder?)
- PWA requirements (offline-first?)
- Mock data scope

### Phase 2: Plan Creation (Sonnet)
**Create:** `koder/plans/12_admin-spa-rebuild.md`

**Include:**
1. Architecture overview (components, state, routing)
2. Design system (colors, typography, spacing)
3. Features & pages (with wireframes/descriptions)
4. Technical specs (ES6 modules, API client, mock system)
5. Implementation phases (Foundation → Core → Advanced → Polish)
6. File structure (complete directory layout)

### Phase 3: Next Session Prep (Sonnet)
**Update:** `koder/NEXT_SESSION.md` → Points to build phase

## 🎨 User's Vision Summary

**Core Constraints:**
- No build tools (Vanilla JS/HTML/CSS)
- Tailwind CSS CDN
- PWA-capable
- Independent development folder

**Key Features:**
- Mock data system (`?mock-data`)
- Light/Dark mode
- Theme: Orange rgb(255, 149, 0)
- Inter font, nice icons
- No layout janks (fixed layout, panels scroll)
- Memoized API calls
- Loading skeletons
- Native-like UX

**Philosophy:**
> "Build the UI to delight. This is the first impression of Fazt. Make it elegant, functional, and delightful."
