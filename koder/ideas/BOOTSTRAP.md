# Brainstorming

## Context

- Please review the repo to understand what the project is
- where it is in capability/features/version

## Architecting Workflow

- Instead of building fazt, we are ideating the evolution of fazt
- Why: so that we have a long tail capability mapped out to see if our steps in
  building can be modified to reach the final outcome in more efficient steps
  and to avoid rework
- As of now the project can evolved from the current code checkpoint to a much
  more capable/flexible/extensible system through the ideas/Brainstorming
  sessions
- I want to continue to a point where we are doing a virtual building of fazt
  until we reach some version where we can stop, relook all the ideas and see
  how to build it
- So, to help me with this Brainstorming exercise, do the following:

### Simulation

1. Understand the current state super well
2. Understand why/philosophy/reasoning for building this
3. Assign yourself as my co-developer / co-architect
4. Then go through each idea, and simulate a situation when they are actually
   implemented in code & binary is now capable enough with these features
5. So, we can brainstorm / ideate on this capability surface for newer ideas
6. Feel free to keep versioning and set a new version that has all these
   features and help me with newer ideas assuming these are already
   present/implemented
