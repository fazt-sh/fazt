## Executive Summary

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of Supabase, an open-source platform that has rapidly emerged as a leading backend-as-a-service (BaaS) solution. The research delves into key statistics concerning platform scale, user base, pricing models, and typical application usage patterns. The findings indicate that Supabase has achieved significant traction, boasting a developer community of over 4.5 million and powering millions of databases worldwide. The platform's pricing is designed to be highly scalable, with a generous free tier that accommodates hobbyists and early-stage projects, and a pro plan starting at $25 per month for production applications. Usage metrics reveal that while many users operate within the free or base-tier limits, the platform is capable of supporting high-growth applications with substantial resource demands. The most common use cases range from AI-driven applications and SaaS products to social discovery apps and enterprise solutions, highlighting the platform's versatility and broad appeal.

## Platform Scale and Growth

Supabase has experienced exponential growth, particularly in its developer community. As of October 2025, the platform supports over **4.5 million developers**, a significant increase from 1 million just a year prior [1]. This rapid adoption is a testament to the platform's developer-friendly features and open-source nature. While specific numbers for total applications or projects are not publicly disclosed, Supabase reports that **tens of thousands of new databases are created daily**, and the platform powers **millions of databases globally** [1]. The company serves over **100,000 customers**, including major enterprises such as PwC, McDonald's, and Github Next, underscoring its credibility and market penetration [2]. This growth is further validated by a recent Series E funding round of $100 million, valuing the company at $5 billion [2].

| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| **Developers/Accounts** | Over 4.5 million                               | [1]       |
| **Databases**           | Millions worldwide, tens of thousands created daily | [1]       |
| **Customers**             | Over 100,000                                   | [2]       |
| **Valuation**             | $5 billion (as of October 2025)                | [2]       |

## Pricing and User Spending

Supabase's pricing model is structured to be accessible for individual developers while scaling to meet the needs of large enterprises. The spending patterns are heavily concentrated at two main tiers: the **Free Plan** ($0/month) and the **Pro Plan** ($25/month base price). The Free Plan is popular for hobby projects and MVPs, offering substantial limits that allow many applications to operate without cost. The Pro Plan is the standard for production applications, and for many users, the $25 base fee constitutes their entire monthly bill.

Costs increase beyond the base price primarily due to two factors: the need for more powerful dedicated compute resources and usage that exceeds the included quotas. For instance, a user with a Medium compute add-on might pay around $75 per month. For high-growth applications, overage charges for Monthly Active Users (MAU), database storage, and egress bandwidth become the main cost drivers. A case study of the event ticketing platform Shotgun, which serves over 3 million users, revealed a cost reduction from $12,000 to $2,155 per month after migrating to Supabase, demonstrating the platform's cost-effectiveness at scale [3].

## Typical Application Usage Metrics

Usage patterns on Supabase are highly variable and depend on the application's nature and scale. The platform's generous free and pro tier quotas accommodate a wide range of use cases.

### Bandwidth (Egress)

Egress, or data transferred out of Supabase, is a key usage metric. The Free Plan includes 5 GB of egress, while the Pro Plan offers a much larger 250 GB. Egress is generated by database queries, file storage downloads, and real-time data subscriptions. Unoptimized queries and high-traffic applications can lead to significant egress consumption. For example, a high-concurrency real-time benchmark with 250,000 users generated over 600 GB of data transfer [4].

### Storage

New projects start with a small database footprint of 40-60 MB. The Free Plan provides 500 MB of database storage and 1 GB of file storage. The Pro Plan significantly increases this to 8 GB of database storage and 100 GB of file storage, with the ability to scale up to 60 TB. The platform's auto-scaling feature expands disk size by 50% when it reaches 90% capacity, indicating that databases in the hundreds of gigabytes are an expected pattern for growing applications [5].

### Other Resources

- **Database Connections:** Supabase uses a connection pooler (Supavisor) to efficiently manage database connections. The default paid instance allows for 60 direct connections and a pool size of 200, enabling a small number of connections to serve a large user base [6].
- **API Requests:** While the Free Plan offers "unlimited" API requests, they are practically limited by compute resources. Higher-tier compute add-ons can handle over 10,000 requests per second [7].
- **Realtime Connections:** The Free Plan supports 200 concurrent Realtime connections, while the Pro Plan includes 500, with overage charges for additional connections [8].

## Common Use Cases and Applications

Supabase's versatility is reflected in the wide array of applications built on the platform. It has become a popular choice for:

- **AI-Driven Applications:** Leveraging the Vector extension for PostgreSQL, developers are building AI chatbots, social media managers, and other AI-powered tools.
- **SaaS Products:** The platform's scalability and cost-effectiveness make it ideal for building and scaling SaaS applications.
- **Social and Community Apps:** Real-time features and authentication make it well-suited for social discovery and community-based applications.
- **Fintech and Payments:** Supabase is used by fintech companies for building secure and scalable payment platforms.
- **Enterprise Solutions:** Large enterprises are using Supabase for internal tools, customer-facing applications, and migrating critical infrastructure.

Case studies consistently highlight significant improvements in developer productivity and cost savings. For example, some companies have reported an **8x improvement in developer speed** and a **75% reduction in development time** after adopting Supabase [9].

## Conclusion

Supabase has successfully carved out a significant niche in the BaaS market by offering a powerful, flexible, and developer-friendly platform. Its open-source nature, combined with a scalable pricing model and a comprehensive feature set, has attracted a large and rapidly growing developer community. For anyone building an open-source alternative, it is crucial to consider the following:
