* **What I Found**: A secure implementation of Platform-Agnostic Security Tokens, a better alternative to JWT.
* **Extraction Opportunity**: Token signing and verification logic (Version 4/Public).
* **Verdict: EXTRACT (`auth-lite`)**.
* **Why**: Replaces complex JWT implementations for Fazt's internal API and user auth tokens.

* **Extraction Opportunity**: The **LSM-lite** pattern for append-only logs.
* **Verdict: PATTERN**.
* **Why**: Use the Bitcask design for high-throughput analytics ingestion before flushing to the main SQLite DB.

### 5. Tus-go (Resumable Uploads)

* **What I Found**: Go implementation of the tus resumable upload protocol.
* **Extraction Opportunity**: The PATCH-based resumable logic.
* **Verdict: EXTRACT (`deploy-lite`)**.
* **Why**: Makes `fazt deploy` extremely resilient on bad networks. Large assets can be uploaded in chunks.

### 6. Gopsutil (System Metrics)

* **What I Found**: Cross-platform library for retrieving process and system utilization (CPU, RAM, Disk).
* **Extraction Opportunity**: The Linux-specific `procfs` parsers.
* **Verdict: EXTRACT (`sys-lite`)**.
* **Why**: Powers the "System Health" and "Dashboard" pages with real-time hardware metrics without needing CGO.

### 7. ULID (Universally Unique Lexicographically Sortable Identifiers)

* **What I Found**: Sortable unique identifiers that are 128-bit compatible with UUID.
* **Extraction Opportunity**: Generation logic using crypto/rand.
* **Verdict: EXTRACT (`id-lite`)**.
* **Why**: Provides the perfect ID for analytics events—unique across deployments but naturally sorted by time.

### 8. GJSON (Fast JSON Access)

* **What I Found**: A library to get JSON values with one line of code, without unmarshaling.
* **Extraction Opportunity**: The JSON Path query engine.
* **Verdict: EXTRACT (`json-lite`)**.
* **Why**: Critical for the JS Serverless runtime. Allows functions to query large JSON blobs stored in SQLite without the memory overhead of full parsing.

### 9. Lingua-go (Language Detection)

* **What I Found**: Accurate language detection for long and short text.
* **Extraction Opportunity**: The N-gram based detection algorithm.
* **Verdict: PATTERN**.
* **Why**: Automates language tags for analytics and user sites, improving search indexing and SEO.

### 10. SCS (Session Manager)

* **What I Found**: A session manager for HTTP servers with pluggable backends.
* **Extraction Opportunity**: The middleware-based session state management.
* **Verdict: EXTRACT (`session-lite`)**.
* **Why**: Standardizes how the Admin Dashboard and user sites handle login state in the SQLite VFS.

### 11. Watermill (Message Streams)

* **What I Found**: A library for working with message streams and building event-driven apps.
* **Extraction Opportunity**: The **Pub/Sub interface pattern**.
* **Verdict: PATTERN**.
* **Why**: Guides the design of Fazt's "Events as spine" system—routing internal deploy events to notification sinks.

### 12. Goldmark (Markdown Processor)

* **What I Found**: A highly extendable CommonMark compliant Markdown parser.
* **Extraction Opportunity**: The core parser and HTML renderer.
* **Verdict: EXTRACT (`markdown-lite`)**.
* **Why**: Allows the Fazt PaaS to auto-render `.md` files in the VFS as static pages on the fly.

### 13. Afero (FileSystem Abstraction)

* **What I Found**: A complete filesystem abstraction system for Go.
* **Extraction Opportunity**: The **`Fs` interface** and the `MemMapFs` implementation.
* **Verdict: PATTERN**.
* **Why**: Standardizes Fazt's VFS logic to be compatible with Go's `io/fs`, allowing standard Go tools to work with DB-stored files.

### 14. Benthos (Stream Pipeline)

* **What I Found**: A message streaming bridge between various protocols.
* **Extraction Opportunity**: The **Bloblang** mapping language pattern.
* **Verdict: PATTERN**.
* **Why**: Provides inspiration for how Fazt users can "map" incoming webhooks to internal events.

### 15. Ozzo-validation (Rules-based Validation)

* **What I Found**: Supports validation of various data types using code constructs rather than tags.
* **Extraction Opportunity**: The rule composition logic.
* **Verdict: EXTRACT (`val-lite`)**.
* **Why**: Hardens the internal API handlers with a clean, fluent validation DSL.

### 16. Go-resty (Enhanced HTTP Client)

* **What I Found**: A simple HTTP and REST client for Go.
* **Extraction Opportunity**: The **Retry and Backoff** logic.
* **Verdict: EXTRACT (`fetch-lite`)**.
* **Why**: Enhances the serverless `WebFetch` primitive with automatic retries for flaky external APIs.

### 17. Pterm (CLI Beautification)

* **What I Found**: A library to beautify console output on every platform.
* **Extraction Opportunity**: The progress bar and live-updating area logic.
* **Verdict: EXTRACT (`term-lite`)**.
* **Why**: Improves the `fazt` CLI experience during installation and deployment.

### 18. Goview (Template Engine)

* **What I Found**: Lightweight template library based on `html/template`.
* **Extraction Opportunity**: The template layout and partials pattern.
* **Verdict: PATTERN**.
* **Why**: Simplifies how Fazt renders its internal Landing Page and 404 pages using shared layouts.

### 19. Arpc (Effective Network Communication)

* **What I Found**: Network communication supporting two-way calling and broadcast.
* **Extraction Opportunity**: The binary framing logic.
* **Verdict: PATTERN**.
* **Why**: Used for Phase 3 "Cluster" mode—efficiently syncing state between multiple Fazt nodes over a single port.

### 20. Go-qrcode (Pairing)

* **What I Found**: A library to generate QR codes with personalized styles.
* **Extraction Opportunity**: The core matrix generation logic.
* **Verdict: EXTRACT (`qr-lite`)**.
* **Why**: Enables "Instant CLI Pairing." The server prints a QR code in the terminal to set up the mobile app or client auth.
