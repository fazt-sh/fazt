Following the **Lite Extraction Analysis** process, I have conducted a fifth deep research pass through the `awesome-go.md` list. Here are 20 additional high-value extraction candidates that align with Fazt's **Cartridge Architecture** (Single Binary, Pure Go, Single SQLite DB, Zero Dependencies).

### 1. Rqlite (Distributed SQLite)

* **What I Found**: A lightweight, distributed relational database built on SQLite.
* **Extraction Opportunity**: The **node-to-node replication logic** using Raft consensus.
* **Verdict**: **PATTERN**. provides the blueprint for "Phase 3" node clustering, allowing multiple Fazt binaries to keep their `data.db` files in sync across a network.

### 2. Badger (LSM Storage Engine)

* **What I Found**: A fast key-value store in Go.
* **Extraction Opportunity**: The **Value Log (VLog)** and **Log-Structured Merge-tree (LSM)** patterns for high-write analytics.
* **Verdict**: **PATTERN**. Used for high-throughput ingestion of analytics events before flushing them to the main SQLite database.

### 3. Immudb (Immutable DB)

* **What I Found**: A lightweight, high-speed immutable database.
* **Extraction Opportunity**: The **tamper-proof audit log** pattern (cryptographic verification of history).
* **Verdict**: **EXTRACT (`audit-lite`)**. Provides a verifiable log of all administrative actions in the Admin Dashboard.

### 4. Restic (Deduplication)

* **What I Found**: A fast, secure, and efficient backup program.
* **Extraction Opportunity**: The **Content-Defined Chunking (CDC)** algorithm for file deduplication.
* **Verdict**: **EXTRACT (`dedup-lite`)**. Significantly reduces the size of the SQLite `data.db` when users deploy multiple versions of the same site or asset.

### 5. Syncthing (P2P Sync Protocol)

* **What I Found**: An open, decentralized file synchronization tool.
* **Extraction Opportunity**: The **Block Exchange Protocol (BEP)** for delta-syncing files.
* **Verdict**: **PATTERN**. Guides how Fazt binaries sync large sites over flaky networks by only transferring changed blocks.

### 6. Traefik (Edge Routing)

* **What I Found**: A modern HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer.
* **Extraction Opportunity**: The **dynamic middleware chain** pattern.
* **Verdict**: **PATTERN**. Standardizes how Fazt handles per-route features like auth, analytics, and rate-limiting.

### 7. Minio (S3-Compatible API)

* **What I Found**: A distributed object storage server.
* **Extraction Opportunity**: The **S3 API layer** implementation.
* **Verdict**: **EXTRACT (`s3-lite`)**. Allows Fazt's VFS (stored in SQLite) to present an S3-compatible interface, enabling standard tools (like `aws cli`) to manage files.

### 8. Etcd (Consensus Engine)

* **What I Found**: A highly-available key-value store for shared configuration.
* **Extraction Opportunity**: The **Raft consensus mechanism** implementation.
* **Verdict**: **DEFER**. Critical for cluster leader election in Phase 3, but complex to implement "lite".

### 9. Bbolt (B+Tree Key-Value)

* **What I Found**: An embedded key/value database for Go.
* **Extraction Opportunity**: The **direct file-mapped storage** pattern.
* **Verdict**: **PATTERN**. Provides inspiration for how specific cartridge types can bypass standard SQL for high-performance indexing.

### 10. Viper (Configuration Merging)

* **What I Found**: A complete configuration solution for Go.
* **Extraction Opportunity**: The **multi-source merging logic** (Environment variables, JSON, and CLI flags).
* **Verdict**: **EXTRACT (`cfg-lite`)**. Standardizes how the Fazt binary resolves configuration overrides.

### 11. Cobra (CLI Architecture)

* **What I Found**: A library for creating powerful modern CLI applications.
* **Extraction Opportunity**: The **subcommand tree** and **automatic help generation** logic.
* **Verdict**: **PATTERN**. Already partially adopted, but can be "lite-extracted" to minimize CLI code bloat while keeping powerful features like auto-completion.

### 12. Zerolog (JSON Logging)

* **What I Found**: A zero-allocation JSON logger.
* **Extraction Opportunity**: The **allocation-free buffer** pattern for structured logs.
* **Verdict**: **EXTRACT (`log-lite`)**. Ensures that system logs in the single binary do not cause memory pressure during high traffic.

### 13. Go-i18n (Localization)

* **What I Found**: A package and tool to work with localized text.
* **Extraction Opportunity**: The **translation interpolation and pluralization** engine.
* **Verdict**: **EXTRACT (`intl-lite`)**. Enables the Admin Dashboard and user sites to support multiple languages using simple JSON translation files.

### 14. Govalidator (Data Validation)

* **What I Found**: Validators and sanitizers for strings, numerics, and structs.
* **Extraction Opportunity**: The **standardized string/format regex checks** (e.g., URL, Email, IP validation).
* **Verdict**: **EXTRACT (`check-lite`)**. Hardens the internal API handlers with a unified validation suite.

### 15. Air (Hot Reload)

* **What I Found**: Live reload for Go apps.
* **Extraction Opportunity**: The **file-watch-to-binary-restart** logic.
* **Verdict**: **EXTRACT (`dev-lite`)**. Powers a `fazt dev` command that watches local site changes and syncs them to a development instance instantly.

### 16. Stateless (State Machines)

* **What I Found**: A fluent library for creating state machines.
* **Extraction Opportunity**: The **state transition and trigger logic**.
* **Verdict**: **EXTRACT (`fsm-lite`)**. Manages the complex lifecycle of sites and cartridges (e.g., `Queued -> Deploying -> Active -> Healthy/Unhealthy`).

### 17. Gopsutil (Hardware Monitoring)

* **What I Found**: A cross-platform library for retrieving system utilization (CPU, Memory, Disk).
* **Extraction Opportunity**: The **Linux procfs parsers** for hardware metrics.
* **Verdict**: **EXTRACT (`stats-lite`)**. Adds detailed system health charts to the Admin Dashboard without external agents.

### 18. Gocron (Job Scheduler)

* **What I Found**: Easy and fluent Go job scheduling.
* **Extraction Opportunity**: The **cron expression parsing and interval tracking** logic.
* **Verdict**: **EXTRACT (`job-lite`)**. Allows users to schedule serverless functions (e.g., "run this script every midnight") directly in the binary.

### 19. PP (Pretty Printer)

* **What I Found**: A colored pretty printer for Go.
* **Extraction Opportunity**: The **colorful, recursive value dumping** logic.
* **Verdict**: **EXTRACT (`term-lite`)**. Enhances the CLI's `fazt inspect` command for debugging JSON objects in the terminal.

### 20. FZF (Fuzzy Matching)

* **What I Found**: A command-line fuzzy finder.
* **Extraction Opportunity**: The **fuzzy search algorithm** (scoring and ranking).
* **Verdict**: **EXTRACT (`search-lite`)**. Powers the "Quick Switcher" in the Admin Dashboard, allowing users to jump between sites and settings with a few keystrokes.

### Final Extraction Matrix (Batch 6)

| Category | High Value Extraction | Primary Benefit for Fazt |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Storage** | `Restic`, `Minio`, `Badger` | Storage efficiency and S3-compatibility for the VFS. |
| **Clustering** | `Rqlite`, `Syncthing` | The foundation for Phase 3 multi-node syncing. |
| **Observability** | `Zerolog`, `Gopsutil`, `PP` | Zero-overhead logging and hardware monitoring. |
| **UX/DX** | `FZF`, `Gocron`, `Air` | Better admin search, job scheduling, and dev mode. |
| **Kernel** | `Stateless`, `Viper`, `Go-i18n` | Stronger internal state, config, and i18n logic. |

**Next Step**: I recommend creating a spec for **`dedup-lite`** at `koder/ideas/specs/v0.9-storage/deduplication.md` as it will significantly improve the storage efficiency of the single SQLite database.
