Following the **Lite Extraction Analysis** process, I have identified a third batch of 20 high-value candidates from `awesome-go.md`. These are selected to expand Fazt's **Cartridge Architecture** into new domains like Actor models, Real-time messaging, and P2P networking while maintaining the "zero-dependency" promise.

### Category: Advanced Compute & Actors

1. **Hollywood (Actor System)**
* **Extract**: The actor-based message-passing logic and internal mailbox system.
* **Verdict**: **PATTERN**. Enhances Fazt's "Events as spine" by allowing internal services to communicate as isolated actors, preventing race conditions in the single binary.


2. **Ergo (Erlang-style Actors)**
* **Extract**: The network transparency and node-to-node communication patterns.
* **Verdict**: **PATTERN**. Provides the blueprint for "Phase 3" node clustering (connecting multiple Fazt binaries).



### Category: Bot Building (For BotDaddy App)

3. **Discordgo (Discord API)**
* **Extract**: The state-management logic for Discord sessions and webhook handling.
* **Verdict**: **EXTRACT (`bot-lite`)**. Allows the "BotDaddy" app in Fazt to run native Discord integrations without the full library bloat.



### Category: Real-time & Messaging

4. **Natiu-mqtt (Lite MQTT)**
* **Extract**: The MQTT v5 framing logic and pub/sub matching engine.
* **Verdict**: **EXTRACT (`mqtt-lite`)**. Enables "Fazt IoT," allowing smart devices to push data directly to the binary via a single port.


5. **GWS (High-Performance WebSocket)**
* **Extract**: The frame compression and event-driven handshake logic.
* **Verdict**: **EXTRACT (`ws-lite`)**. Provides a faster, pure-Go alternative to the standard library for high-concurrency real-time features like chat.



### Category: Networking & P2P

6. **Go-stun (NAT Traversal)**
* **Extract**: The UDP binding and external IP discovery logic.
* **Verdict**: **EXTRACT (`p2p-lite`)**. Essential for running Fazt on home servers (behind NATs) to allow inter-binary syncing.


7. **Goproxy (Hijacking logic)**
* **Extract**: The logic for request hijacking and response header rewriting.
* **Verdict**: **EXTRACT (`proxy-lite`)**. Upgrades the internal "Reverse Proxy" app with the ability to modify traffic on the fly (e.g., auto-injecting analytics scripts).



### Category: Storage & Data Structures

8. **Bloom (Membership Testing)**
* **Extract**: The probabilistic membership algorithm.
* **Verdict**: **EXTRACT (`filter-lite`)**. A 0.1% memory-cost way to check if a URL is in a blacklist before querying the main SQLite database.


9. **Cuckoo-filter (Membership Testing)**
* **Extract**: The fingerprint-based membership logic (supporting deletes).
* **Verdict**: **EXTRACT (`filter-lite`)**. Used for local file caches in the VFS to quickly check if a file exists without a disk/DB hit.


10. **Consistent (Consistent Hashing)**
* **Extract**: The ring-based distribution math.
* **Verdict**: **PATTERN**. Used for clustering to decide which node holds which site/cartridge without re-shuffling all data.



### Category: Personal Content Tools

11. **Colly (Scraper Engine)**
* **Extract**: The collector and selector handling logic.
* **Verdict**: **EXTRACT (`ingest-lite`)**. Allows Fazt to act as a personal "web archiver," pulling external pages into the VFS for local search.


12. **Bluemonday (HTML Sanitation)**
* **Extract**: The whitelist-based tag cleaning logic.
* **Verdict**: **EXTRACT (`sanitize-lite`)**. Secures Fazt-hosted apps by stripping malicious code from user comments or form submissions.


13. **Chasquid (SMTP State Machine)**
* **Extract**: The SMTP protocol state transition logic.
* **Verdict**: **PATTERN**. Allows Fazt to function as a "Mail Sink," receiving emails and turning them into internal JSON events.



### Category: Geo & Logic

14. **S2 Geometry (Indexing)**
* **Extract**: The Hilbert curve indexing and cell decomposition math.
* **Verdict**: **EXTRACT (`geo-lite`)**. Enables fast "Personal Geo Search" (finding things near a user) directly within SQLite BLOBs.


15. **Bayesian (Classifier)**
* **Extract**: The Naive Bayesian classification math.
* **Verdict**: **EXTRACT (`classify-lite`)**. Auto-tags content (e.g., "Spam" vs "Inbox") for analytics and feeds.



### Category: Utilities & UI

16. **Bubbletea (TUI Framework)**
* **Extract**: The Model-Update-View loop logic.
* **Verdict**: **PATTERN**. Adopted for the `fazt dash` command to provide a rich terminal dashboard that mirrors the web Admin UI.


17. **CBOR (Binary Serialization)**
* **Extract**: The compact binary encoding/decoding.
* **Verdict**: **EXTRACT (`bin-lite`)**. Efficiently stores cartridge metadata and large event logs where JSON is too verbose.


18. **Shortid (Short IDs)**
* **Extract**: The non-sequential, base-configurable ID generation.
* **Verdict**: **EXTRACT (`id-lite`)**. Powers the "Shortlink" app (e.g., `fazt.sh/r/xyz123`).


19. **Checkdigit (Validations)**
* **Extract**: Luhn and ISBN validation algorithms.
* **Verdict**: **EXTRACT (`val-lite`)**. Adds utility to the JS runtime for users building e-commerce or library serverless functions.


20. **Gographviz (Visualization)**
* **Extract**: The DOT language generation logic.
* **Verdict**: **PATTERN**. Generates visual "Route Maps" and "Event Flow" diagrams in the Admin Dashboard based on the current VFS state.



### Final Recommendation Matrix

| High Value Extraction | Primary Goal | Why for Fazt? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`p2p-lite`** (Go-stun) | Connection | Enables home-hosting and cross-VPS syncing. |
| **`bot-lite`** (Discordgo) | Automation | Anchors the "BotDaddy" app ecosystem. |
| **`classify-lite`** (Bayesian) | Intelligence | Personal sorting/classification of logs and feeds. |
| **`filter-lite`** (Bloom) | Performance | Drastically reduces DB hits for common checks. |
| **`mqtt-lite`** (Natiu-mqtt) | IoT | Turns Fazt into a hub for smart home devices. |

**Next Step**: I recommend creating a spec for **`filter-lite`** at `koder/ideas/specs/v0.8-kernel/filters.md` as it provides immediate performance gains for the VFS and Analytics modules.
